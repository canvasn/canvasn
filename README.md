 * ### Token Economy
   
The art market has continued to rise in value over more than a thousand years
since the Middle Ages in Europe, and it has been shown that the profit structures of
participants are changing in a variety of ways.
The variety of this profit structure will be reflected in the token economy that GalleryCoin
plans to create. The greatest variety of art, from traditional artworks to future-focused Art
NFT is offered by the Canvas N art ecosystem. Additionally, by luring diverse market
participants, from standard art transactions to blockchain-based payment mechanisms
like metaverse, we are creating a token ecosystem. The growth of galleries, artists, NFT
teams, and collectors will coincide with the expansion of the art market in the transparent
token economy of GalleryCoin.
These are the key components of GalleryCoin, the reason for allocation, and the usage
strategy.
   
   
 ##  Project Contents


Although it is easier for ordinary people to access the art market than before, the barriers to entry are still higher than in other markets.
In addition, problems such as risks to counterfeit art piece and opaque distribution processes occur frequently.

To solve these problems, we developed the art distribution process by combining it with the Blockchain system.
Canvas N combines the blockchain with the art market as follows.

 * ### 1. Digital Guarantee Service: Artwork NFT Certificate

Presently, issues with tax evasion or the concealment of criminal funds in the art 
distribution process are also worsening public awareness of art transactions and eroding 
trust between the parties. These issues also exist in the art market, where issues with 
fraud and forgery continue to occur.

To address these challenges, Canvas N offers a digital guarantee service to ensure that 
customers who purchase artwork believe it is genuine. The service is realized by "issuing 
an NFT Certificate", which refers to entering distribution information, artwork information, 
and the source of the work in the real art transaction into the guarantee, issuing the 
guarantee as an NFT, and storing it permanently and invariably through blockchain 
records. Canvas N supports NFT certificates as well as physical artwork guarantees when 
trading art. Subsequently, you can check the authenticity, provenance, and transaction 
history within the platform through the blockchain book recorded in the NFT certificate

 * ### 2. Metaverse Gallery

Users of the platform can enjoy exhibitions in metaverse galleries by Canvas N. The 
Canvas N Metaverse enables NFT art exhibitions, and rental services in addition to 
converting and displaying the works of artists and galleries who choose to participate in 
Canvas N as ultra-high resolution materials. Using the infinitely flexible metaverse 
exhibition hall, anybody can access the advantages of cultural infrastructure from any 
location. This makes it feasible to engage in creative work activities that were previously 
impossible due to the constraints of physical space-time.

Users can freely sell and display Web 3.0-based artworks in the Metaverse Gallery, 
where they can also enjoy a variety of artistic values from around the world. The 
Metaverse Gallery is where genuine NFT artworks are traded, and there are no 
exchange fees or exchange rate concerns when using GalleryCoin.

The history of Canvas N's digital art displays includes the use of VFX and blockchain 
technologies like the Milkomeda N Project and GalleryCoin. These skills can be used to 
create metaverse environments that are appropriate for the creative setting, and 
Canvas N curators can offer specialized curatorial services.

Users can also take advantage of the manufacturing and consumption aspects of the 
GalleryCoin token economy in the metaverse.

 * ### 3. NFT Minting / NFT Marketplace

Based on their expertise in managing a variety of NFT projects, Canvas N which had the 
experience of issuing Milkomeda N offers consulting services to clients who directly issue 
or wish to issue NFTs. It is feasible to offer integrated solutions from NFT generating, 
mining technology support, and secondary transaction marketplaces after the formation 
of NFT business models and business models. Together with technical support, Canvas N 
also offers operational expertise on a range of challenges that could come up before and 
after mining. Even after issuing, we will continue to promote the creation of numerous 
alliances and community networks through brand and marketing management for the 
appropriate NFT ecosystem, boosting the project's worth.

NFT Marketplace is supported by Canvas N, which offers a trading platform designed 
specifically for PFP NFT and Art NFT. We will support other networks, including Gallery 
Coin (GLR) and Clayton, starting with Ethereum (ETH), which makes up the majority of the 
NFT market (KLAY). By using words and user-friendly interfaces that are friendly to local 
users and giving information on both domestic and foreign NFT initiatives, it will improve 
usability. Additionally, it will open up new doors for upcoming artists and serve as a 
launching pad for galleries and established artists to access the NFT market.

Beyond solving these problems, Canvas N aims to provide a new paradigm.

Canvas N is created to build an art-investment platform that offers a unique experience with collaborations with different galleries and art auction companies at domestic and abroad to successfully carry out the following responsibilities.

1. The objective is to create a platform that enables simple online trade of galleries and artwork by domestic and international artists.

2. To create a representative NFT market both domestically and internationally (handling only the PFP project and NFT Art)

3. The development of Metaverse Gallery offers a cutting-edge art ecosystem.

4. The issuance of NFT guarantees will increase transparency in the art provenance process.

5. Construction of the Art and Art NFT Auction Market

6. Canvas N Platform and Ecosystem Development and GalleryCoin Issued.

7. Community Institution (Enhance VIP membership by issuing 10,000 Milkomeda N)

8. Establish an offline gallery to improve service and dependability (given experience and Gallery/NFT exhibition)

9. Discovering and promoting rising artists.

10. Donation to strengthen culture and art.
